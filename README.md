## About the Book
Streamlit has transformed how developers present data science and machine-learning work by making it effortless to turn Python scripts into interactive web applications. Building Data Apps with Streamlit provides a complete, hands-on roadmap to creating professional, production-ready apps using Streamlit’s fast, intuitive, and Pythonic framework.


You begin with Streamlit’s architecture, layout system, and component ecosystem, learning how to build clean, scalable apps with widgets, callbacks, caching, and session state. The book then guides you through handling secrets, managing configurations, working with APIs and databases, and building multipage workflows that feel polished and responsive. 
By the end, you will build a full Streamlit solution that analyzes datasets, trains machine-learning models, and powers an AI chatbot using Google Gemini. With dedicated chapters on testing, optimization, and cloud deployment, this book equips you with the confidence and skills to create, iterate, and share high-quality Streamlit applications that bring your data and ideas to life.
